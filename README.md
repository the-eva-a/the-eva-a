# :wave:Hi-Diddly-Ho, Neighborino!:balloon:

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet :computer:. My name is Eva (like in [Wall-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JVw8eofx8Q))
and I love solving problems, creating new things :yarn:, and being a lifelong learner :book:. 


## 🐾 About the Dog

*Let's be real, this is the part you were looking for, right?*

Meet Bella the Dog 🐶, my beloved yellow lab who embodies the paradox of being both an old lady and a baby all at once. She’s a bit of a rascal (especially when snacks are involved), though her digestive system might not agree with her love of treats. Bella has strong opinions about technology—she’ll happily knock the phone out of your hand if it’s stealing her spotlight. But despite her mischievous ways, she’s the softest, most lovable, and very good girl. 🦴💛
