# :wave:Hi-Diddly-Ho, Neighborino!:balloon:

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet :computer:. My name is Eva (like in [Wall-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JVw8eofx8Q))
and I love solving problems, creating new things :yarn:, and being a lifelong learner :book:. 
## 🎡 Eva's Interest Corner

Just because I’m a lifelong learner doesn’t mean I’m a traditional academic. I believe some of the best questions are the silliest ones. I feel lucky to live in a world where, if I really wanted to (and oh, do I ever 😏), I could dive deep and find out which NBA team is the most linearly dense. Does density make them better at basketball? 🏀 Does it matter by position? 🤔 These questions may not change the world, but they sure keep me up at night.

Do you ever find yourself watching a YouTuber make sausage 🌭 and wonder if there’s a correlation between a sausage exploding all over Mark Ruffalo 🤯 and how delicious it turns out? Well, I do, and it’s exactly the kind of absurd curiosity that fuels my love for data. 📊

On a more serious note, I’m fortunate to have both a Master’s degree in Mathematics and an undergraduate education in the liberal arts 🎓, where I was encouraged to learn how to communicate and write—skills I’ve found just as valuable as crunching numbers. Whether I’m modeling everyday phenomena like tsunamis 🌊 or diving deep into quirky data sets, I believe in the power of telling compelling stories through data.

I’m also a bit of a math history nerd. The story of the shepherd who figured out 1-to-1 correspondence warms my heart ❤️, and I will happily maintain that it should be called the Andrew Wiles Theorem rather than Fermat’s Last Theorem. What I love most about math is that it’s often ahead of its time—sometimes centuries ahead of the sciences—leaving plenty of room for exploration and innovation.

## 🎯 What I'm Working On
- 🔧 I’m currently sharpening my skills in an edX Data Analytics Bootcamp, diving deeper into data analysis, visualization, and all things Python.
- 🌭 Yes, I’m seriously working on that sausage analysis project—because who doesn't want to uncover the statistical secrets of sausages?
- 🐍 I’m on a mission to become proficient in Python by tackling small, fun projects that challenge me to keep growing and learning. If you've got cool ideas or projects, hit me up—I’m always open to new opportunities to code! 

## 🐾 About the Dog

*Let's be real, this is the part you were looking for, right?*

Meet Bella the Dog 🐶, my beloved yellow lab who embodies the paradox of being both an old lady and a baby all at once. She’s a bit of a rascal (especially when snacks are involved), though her digestive system might not agree with her love of treats. Bella has strong opinions about technology—she’ll happily knock the phone out of your hand if it’s stealing her spotlight. But despite her mischievous ways, she’s the softest, most lovable, and very good girl. 🦴💛
